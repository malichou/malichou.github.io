      <h2 class="subhead">During the past years, millions of people seeked refuge in Europe. For some, reaching the continent did not mean they now were safe.</h2>

    <div class="story-body">
      <p class="body-text serif">According to United Nation estimates, since the beginning of the refugee crisis, in 2014, over 1.5 million people arrived in Europe. The vast majority of them comes from war-torn countries, such as Syria and Iraq, or countries for long destabilised, such as Afghanistan. In most cases, they set foot in the continent after crossing the Mediterranean, arriving in countries such as Greece, Italy and Spain.</p>
      <p class="body-text serif">However, arriving in Europe does not mean that their journey is over: in fact, as the majority of newly-arrived refugees came with the hope to continue their journey to countries in central and north Europe, for some of them the real journey just now begins. As EU-countries have closed their borders and the refugees have to illegaly try to get to thei prefered destination, on the way they find themselves exposed to risky and at time dangerous conditions.</p>
      <p class="body-text serif"> Since 2014, the International Organization for Migration has been tracking down the incidents in which refugees were reported to be dead or missing while trying to reach another country. In the case of Europe, the data analyzed by insidestory.gr shows that the safety of refugees in Europe is far from ensured after they enter the continent.</p>

      <h3 class="section-head serif">Risks do not end once in Europe</h3>
      <p class="body-text serif">According to these nice UN paragraphs following, that I just copied, an estimated 362,000 refugees and migrants risked their lives crossing the Mediterranean Sea in 2016, with 181,400 people arriving in Italy and 173,450 in Greece. In the first half of 2017, over 105,000 refugees and migrants entered Europe.</p>
      <p class="body-text serif">This movement towards Europe continues to take a devastating toll on human life. Since the beginning of 2017, over 2,700 people are believed to have died or gone missing while crossing the Mediterranean Sea to reach Europe, with reports of many others perishing en route. These risks do not end once in Europe. Those moving onwards irregularly have reported numerous types of abuse, including being pushed back across borders.</p>
      <p class="body-text serif">With so many lives at risk, rescue-at-sea operations undertaken by all actors must remain a priority. Despite some progress in increasing the number of safe pathways to Europe, these opportunities are far too few to offer a feasible alternative to risky irregular journeys for people in need of protection. </p>
