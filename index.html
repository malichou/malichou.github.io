      <p class="body-text serif">All projects are focused around the Greek reality of the recent years. Some have to do with the refugee crisis, others put under examination aspects of the national economy during the years of the financial crisis, while others emphasize into aspects of social co-existence. One of them aims to dig into how Greeks break off a marriage.</p>
      <p class="body-text serif">Data analysis has been done mostly using Python, pandas and libraries such as matplotlib, plotly, Altair, and others. Visualization mostly with Adobe Illustrator, QGIS, and Mapbox.</p>
